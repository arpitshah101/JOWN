# JOWN Prototyping
J.O.W.N. - Just Our Workflow Notation

This is the prototyping repository for prototyping various behavior and learning the technologies in a *sandbox* environment for usage in the actual project codebase.

## Technologies Used so far
1. TypeScript
    * For backend code to provide typechecking despite ultimately being compiled to JavaScript.
2. Gulp
    * Task automation
    * Used to automate build from *src* folder to *dest* folder with compiled JavaScript 
3. Mongoose
    * ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for models to be saved into MongoDB (and provides query language)
4. Mocha --> Chai
    * Automated test framework for JavaScript
    * To be used on backend for sure
    * Possibly used for automated tests on the web components provided as a part of the Polymer Element Catalog
