# Definition Parser

## Description
The Application Developer must have the ability to upload a definition file for the desired workflow. Upon upload of file, the workflow must be parsed and the appropriate data structures must be created for a representation within the system. It is these workflow data structures which serve as "blueprints" for various Workflow Instances created dynamically as requested by users. 

## Implementation Notes
The file must conform to the guidelines set forth in <!-- TODO: link a guidelines file here for XML definition files -->.
